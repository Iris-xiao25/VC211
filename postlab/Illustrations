Postlabs can be the most important part of the course since they account for 60% of the total grade and it takes some effort to write them beautifully. 
Many details should be paid attention to such as the completeness of representation, the accuracy of the curve fitting and etc.
Most of these postlabs are around the A-level but please pay attention to those with scores lower than 92.
The scores of all these postlabs are post1(97), post2(86), post(91), post(93), post(101.5).
Best wishes.
